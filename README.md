Collection of possible student projects.
Projects are stored as submodules.
Each Projects has a short "idea" of the skills the student will have to learn to fully emerge in the project. The skills are not required to start with the project, but a motivation to learn the skills is mandatory. All mehtods required to learn the skills, small crash-courses and regular Q&A sessions will be provided but it is not possible to completly teach everthing under supervised conditions.
